The notebooks in this folder covers the fundamentals to advanced concepts- from image pre-processing to deep learning. Starting with image enhancement and restoration and moving on to biomedical images to analyze more complex image types, like MRI scans and X-rays.  It also includes how to build powerful deep learning image classifiers with deep convolutional neural network.
