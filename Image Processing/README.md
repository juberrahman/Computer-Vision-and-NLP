Much of the data in the world are formatted as images. Image processing has become a crucial skill to have in the data science toolbox. This folder is based on datacamp's Image Processing with Python skill track. It covers the fundamentals to advanced concepts- from image pre-processing to deep learning. The notebooks start with image enhancement and restoration and move on to biomedical images to analyze more complex image types, like MRI scans and X-rays. The track concluded with a course on convolutional neural nets that taught me to build powerful deep learning image classifiers.
