Detecting so-called “fake news” is no easy task. First, there is defining what fake news is – given it has now become a political statement. If you can find or agree upon a definition, then you must collect and properly label real and fake news (hopefully on similar topics to best show clear distinctions). Once collected, you must then find useful features to determine fake from real news.

In this notebook, I explored some NLP methods to build a fake news detector! using the dataset fake_or_real_news.

Pre-processing: CountVectorizer, and TF-IDF Vectorizer

Classifier: Multinomial Naiv Bayes
