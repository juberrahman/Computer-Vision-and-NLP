### Demonstration of the use of advanced pattern recognition techniques for image, text and time series data

Topics included are as below:
* Object Detection and Biomedical image analysis.
* Natural language processing with NLTK, Spacy, Gensim, Polyglot etc.
* Image classification with Deep learning models
* Generation of synthetic multivariate dataset.
* Co-Variance Matrix, Distance Measures
* Dimension reduction: PCA/ SVD, LDA
* Bayesian Parameter Estimation
* Parametric and Non-parametric Density Estimation
* Classification and Clustering
* Expectation Maximization (EM), Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and Bayesian Inference.

N.B. My work on Computer Vision and NLP are not limited to these. My advanced works are reported in my publications.
